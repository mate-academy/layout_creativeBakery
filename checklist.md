## Checklist for preparing a portfolio project for HR review

1. Don’t forget to add a title for the whole web page (it could be the name of your landing)
2. A landing page is implemented strictly according to the design in Figma
4. Links in the header and footer menus should lead to the corresponding blocks of the landing page
5. The speed of animations is the same throughout the landing page (for example, increasing when hovering or moving blocks when scrolling)
6. Placeholders in the forms suggest what to enter, and if there is a validation of the form, then it is clear in what format to enter the phone number
7. Make sure everything looks neat on mobile and without horizontal scrolling
8. Add favicon
9. Add a smooth scroll for the whole page
10. The “learn more” button leads to the “About us” block
11. It would be more realistic if the arrows in the hero section next to the product photo were clickable (or hide these arrows if there are no other photos for the slider)
12. The "all bakeries" button leads to the BakerShops block
13. In the "Bakershops" block, add a drop-down list with a list of cities and addresses in which this store is located (and when you try to click on "Search" let the form just be cleared)
14. When you try to send the Bakershops search form there is no 405 error and the form is automatically cleared after submit and is scrolled to the top of the page or the page is reloaded
15. Menu footer buttons when clicked should lead to the relevant blocks of the landing page
16. The user must have the opportunity to write 2-3 lines of text in the message field
17. In the form at the end of the page, do not forget to add a placeholder for the message field
18. The form shouldn’t accept incorrect data in a field with a phone number (for example, a number with a letter and there was no error), give this and all inputs a correct input type
19. When you try to send the form there is no 405 error and the form is automatically cleared after submit and is scrolled to the top of the page or the page is reloaded
20. The form shouldn’t submit empty
